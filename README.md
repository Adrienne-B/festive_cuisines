# festive_cuisines
I really wanted to push myself with everything I learned from Skrillcrush with a personal project that I did last year using this html/css course on Udemy, which I wanted to improve this year. The difference between the other websites was that there is more pages on here and more activity from CSS and Javascript. The colors and images should give the audience a feel of not only wanting to go to this fictional restaurant but also try the most unique and authentic cuisines from around the world.

Personal Project-Festive Cuisines
Festive Cuisines was one of my first major projects I did in 2020 when I first wanted to learn how to do web design.  I touched based on web design by creating this site using an Udemy course that I bought.  Even though I added my personal ideas and emphases to this site; I still didn’t understand why certain things worked; and I didn’t know anything about responsive websites.  Since learning the tools and skills needed to create a responsive website on Skillcrush; I decided to take my skills to the test and go back into this old project to look over mistakes and improving my layout.
The first time doing this project I didn’t fully understand the difference between sections and divs. Also, I didn’t understand the multiple classes under a section and why they were important.  I didn’t know anything about validators to check mistakes and errors.  But, what I did learn on my own was the parallax effect which I is my favorite thing to see on websites.

While looking back over my work I instantly saw many errors and/or ways to make my layout easy to decipher.  My folder had so many stylesheets and layouts that it was too overwhelming to find certain content.  I used the method of what I learn from Skillcrush by creating a folder and name it for each page that will be created and inside of the folder will be an index.html. Going inside of each page that I did from the old version I had used div classes to create new sections; to make it easier for me to understand I put the section tag with a class and used divs underneath it.  
Also, I noticed that my header and footer on each page were not the same.  I remember at that time I was trying to find a method or a software that would allow me to create a header and footer so that every page would have the same exact look, without having to manually fixing it each time a new element and/or picture was inserted into html.  But, I was never able to find a solution.  This time I used global styles in the main.css, similar to stylesheet, I knew that the problem that I had in 2020 would instantly be solved.
What I enjoyed the most was seeing my growth and how quickly I was able to create seven pages for the cellular size device within a week compared to the struggles I had a few months ago and even last year.  I even saw a difference compared to Skillcrush’s Unplugged-Retreat project.  Of course I still have some challenges a long the way during this process.

Main Challenges for Me
	Overlays ontop of picture, while also having content on top of it..  
	Flexbox 
	Having a background picture border around an element, illusion of the element floating .
	How to differentiate multiple textarea and placeholders to prevent unwanted changes from the wrong textarea and placeholder.
	One specific element won’t cohesively look the same like the rest of it’s group.
	Code block regarding to how to remove the desktop navigation hover from the mobile hamburger navigation bar.
	

Random Unexpected Challenges
	Small picture elements hiding behind a main intro picture element.  
	One part of an entire section wasn’t cohesive even if it matched the other children elements.
	If there’s a background-repeat: no-repeat in css but there is still a picture that is constantly stacking on top of itself.
	Browsers updated system which changed the format to all pages and device sizes.
Solutions
	Don’t use px if they are too high of a number for paddings and margins.
	Don’t use negative numbers for paddings and margins unless it isn’t so high.
	Dev Tools is a MUST, even when Global styles and Media queries has technical difficulties.
	Always make sure that your style sheet links, pictures, and logos are updated.
	Don’t use <br> to separate new sections of a page. Use <br> to separate elements within the sections and/or divs.


Weakness so far:
1.	flexbox is my weakness
2.	Git(updating to the newest rep)
3.	Media Queries
