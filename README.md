# festive_cuisines
I really wanted to push myself with everything I learned from Skrillcrush with a personal project that I did last year using this html/css course on Udemy, which I wanted to improve this year. The difference between the other websites was that there is more pages on here and more activity from CSS and Javascript. The colors and images should give the audience a feel of not only wanting to go to this fictional restaurant but also try the most unique and authentic cuisines from around the world. Pictures that were used were from Pexels.com.

## Summary
Festive Cuisines was one of my first major projects I did in 2020 when I first wanted to learn how to do web design.  I touched based on web design by creating this site using an Udemy course that I bought. But I added my own attributes and emphases to this site to be more personal. I named the website Festive Cuisines because I wanted it to be somehthing that sounds like it would be fun to go to and enjoy meals with family and friends. The main colors are orange and white, but there are other colors that just made teh website even more astonishing.  While going through the site there will be a lot of colors, overlays, information, special effects and pictures regarding food. On the home page there are two buttons: order and reservations. Also, there is an about page to introduce the customrs the top chef who has earned many awards, the executive chef, the stationary chef, and the pastry chef which all have contributed as to why 'Festive Cuisines is popular witihin the nation. There is a FAQ for any questions that need to be answer and there is also a contact page to reach the company. Overall, this website is all about trying food that is influences from around the world but now it is easy to access close to home.


### Software used:
Adobe Dreamweaver and Visual Studio Code

### What I learn:
I learned how to make a hamburger navigation which I implemented in other projects.
How create pop up effects which I implemented in other projects.
Parallax effect which I implemented to my portfolio/resume.

#### Challenges to improve on:
1. Overlays ontop of picture, while also having content on top of it..  
2. Flexbox 

#### Random Unexpected Challenges:
1. Small picture elements hiding behind a main intro picture element.  
2. One part of an entire section wasn’t cohesive even if it matched the other children elements.
3. If there’s a background-repeat: no-repeat in css but there is still a picture that is constantly stacking on top of itself.
4. One specific element won’t cohesively look the same like the rest of it’s group.
5. Code block regarding to how to remove the desktop navigation hover from the mobile hamburger navigation bar.

#### Solutions/solving the issue:
1. Don’t use px if they are too high of a number for paddings and margins.
2. Don’t use negative numbers for paddings and margins unless it isn’t so high.
3. Dev Tools is a MUST, even when Global styles and Media queries has technical difficulties.
4. Always make sure that your style sheet links, pictures, and logos are updated.


#### Weakness so far:
1.	flexbox is my weakness
